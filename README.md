Met Identification with WGAN-GP algorithms.
•Deep learning algorithms have been used to study lost energy momentum, one of the Standard Model Problems in physics. 

•It aims to predict and reconstruct anomalies below the signal region that cannot be easily observed.

•This work is dedicated to the use of a special type of Neural Network called Wassetein Generative Adversial Network-Gradient Penalthy (WGAN-GP).

•WGAN-GP is focused on the search for missing transverse energy and kinematic distributions for charged leptons and jets, which are subatomic particles.

• A correlation has been found between Monte Carlo simulations used to detect particles and WGAN-GP signals that extract the distribution of signals produced under missing energy.
