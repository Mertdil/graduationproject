Met Identification with WGAN-GP algorithms.
In recent years, GANs have gained increasing attention as generative models that are often superior to Variational Autoencoders and have shown very impressive results in image formation. While the Standard Model (SM) has shown great success in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and is far from being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It is therefore
very interesting to integrate these new tools into our search for missing transverse energy. This work is dedicated to the use of a special type of Neural Network called WGAN-GP: WGAN-GP is focused on the search for missing transverse energy and kinematic distributions for charged leptons and jets. It aimed to use the method of missing transverse energy distributions to estimate and predict anomalies below the missing signal region. A correlation between Monte Carlo simulations and WGAN-GP signals was found in extracting a distribution of signals produced under missingenergy.
